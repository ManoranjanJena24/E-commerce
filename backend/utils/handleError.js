// This is an Express error-handling middleware ‚Äî Express automatically knows it's for errors because it has 4 parameters: (err, req, res, next).

// üí° When does Express run this?
// ‚û°Ô∏è Express runs this middleware only if next(error) is called somewhere.

// So you don't call this middleware manually, Express does it whenever an error is passed.
